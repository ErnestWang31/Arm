## Introduction
This project is dedicated to the development of a robotic arm using STM32 microcontrollers. It includes mechanical models, the necessary hardware setup, and the firmware to control the arm. The goal is to create a reliable and functional robotic arm that can be used for educational and prototyping purposes.

## Mechanical Models
The mechanical component of this project involves the design and assembly of a robotic arm. The model files can be found in the "1 Mechanical Models" directory:

- `arm v122.step`: A 3D STEP model of the robotic arm that provides a detailed representation of the mechanical design.

## Hardware
This section covers the hardware components required to build the robotic arm, including motors, sensors, and the STM32 microcontroller board.

## Firmware
The firmware for the STM32 microcontroller is housed within the "3 Firmware" directory. It is designed to control the hardware components of the robotic arm, facilitating precise movements and operations.

### Key Features
- Motor control algorithms
- Sensor feedback integration
- Real-time adjustments and controls

### Source Structure
The source files for the firmware are organized as follows:
- **Core**: Contains the main functionality and initialization code.
- **Drivers**: Includes drivers for the various hardware components.
- **Ctrl**: Control algorithms for motor and sensor operations.
